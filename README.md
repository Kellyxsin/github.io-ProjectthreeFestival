PCOS Awareness Festival 
# project overview
My festival is going to be about women dealing with PCOS and how to manage it for the rest of a women's life. The target audience is women around the age of 15-44 diagnosed with PCOS. Also, family, friends, and doctors would support them. For the three days, everything is going to be in Golden Gate Park because of its charm and being outdoors could be a better experience.
