          <p>Welcome to the three day festival that raises awareness on what PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) actually 
             is. You and many attendees will get to know each other on one of these five educational events. Explore what 
             activities you want to do like going to a panel and listening to experts or a morning workout session. These 
             three days are all about support with a community that comes together while dealing with PCOS. Please come join 
             us between September 1-3!</p>
